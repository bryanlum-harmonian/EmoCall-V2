  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 21, 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Our Promise:</strong> EmoCall is built on privacy. We don't know your name, we don't ask for your email, and we don't record your calls. Your conversations stay between you and your call partner.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>EmoCall is designed to be anonymous by default. Here's what we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Identifier:</strong> A random ID generated on your device to maintain your session. This is not linked to your personal identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Your credits balance, karma points, daily matches count, and premium status.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic app usage statistics like call duration and feature usage to improve our service.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> When you purchase credits or premium, payment processing is handled by our third-party payment provider. We do not store your credit card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email address, or phone number</li>
    <li>Your location (GPS coordinates)</li>
    <li>Voice recordings of your calls</li>
    <li>Contents of your conversations</li>
    <li>Your contacts or photos</li>
    <li>Social media profiles</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Voice Calls</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not record, store, or monitor your voice calls.</strong> Calls are peer-to-peer connections. Once a call ends, there is no record of what was said. We only store metadata like call duration for karma point calculations.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the limited information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Match you with other users based on mood selection (Vent/Listen)</li>
    <li>Track your credits, karma points, and subscription status</li>
    <li>Process payments and provide customer support</li>
    <li>Improve our matching algorithms and app features</li>
    <li>Enforce our Terms of Service and prevent abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. We may share limited data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> To process credit and subscription purchases</li>
    <li><strong>Voice Service Providers:</strong> To facilitate voice call connections (no call content is shared)</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law or to protect user safety</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Session data is retained while your account is active. If you don't use the app for 12 months, your session data may be automatically deleted. You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request access to your session data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data</li>
    <li>Opt out of analytics (contact us)</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>EmoCall is strictly for users 18 years and older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18. If we discover we have collected data from a minor, we will delete it immediately.</p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit and at rest. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app. Continued use of EmoCall after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:</p>
