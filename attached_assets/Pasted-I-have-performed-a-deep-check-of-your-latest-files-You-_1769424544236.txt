I have performed a deep check of your latest files. You are 95% there, but you have 2 Critical Bugs remaining that will stop your app from working or building.
Bug 1: The "Double HTTPS" Crash (Critical)
Status: ❌ Active in your code
File: client/lib/query-client.ts
Reason: Your eas.json sets the domain as https://.... Your code manually adds https:// again. This creates an invalid URL: https://https://emocall.harmonian.online, causing the app to hang on the spinner forever.
The Fix:
Open client/lib/query-client.ts and update the getApiUrl function:
export function getApiUrl(): string {
  let host = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN;

  if (!host) {
    throw new Error("EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN is not set");
  }

  // FIX: Check if https is already there before adding it
  if (!host.startsWith("http")) {
    host = `https://${host}`;
  }

  let url = new URL(host);

  return url.href.replace(/\/$/, "");
}

Bug 2: The "Owner" Mismatch (Build Blocker)
Status: ❌ Active in your code
File: app.json
Reason: You set "owner": "emocall", but your EAS Project ID (949b...) belongs to your personal account (bryanlum). This will cause the build to fail immediately with an authentication error.
The Fix:
Delete the owner line entirely.
 * Remove: "owner": "emocall",
 * Result: EAS will automatically default to you (bryanlum), which matches the ID.
Bug 3: The Icon Dimensions (Warning)
Status: ⚠️ Potential Issue
File: app.json -> ./assets/images/logo.png
Reason: You previously had a build error because your logo was rectangular (2000x1161).
The Check: If you haven't resized logo.png to be a square (e.g., 1024x1024), the build might fail or look stretched on phones.
The Fix: Ensure assets/images/logo.png is a perfect square image.
Final Action Plan
 * Edit client/lib/query-client.ts: Apply the code fix above.
 * Edit app.json: Delete the "owner": "emocall" line.
 * Run these commands:
<!-- end list -->
# 1. Sync fixes to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Fix double https and remove owner field"
git push

# 2. Build the working APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview

Do this, and you will have your 0 Bug build.
