The UI is looking great! I have decided to standardize the currency to USD for a global launch.

Please implement these 5 specific changes to align with the final business model:

### 1. PRICING & CURRENCY (USD Strategy)
Change all Store prices to **USD**.
To keep the "Micro-transaction" feel (approx $0.45 per extension), please update the Credit Packages to these exact tiers:
- **Starter Pack ($0.99):** 250 Credits (Enough for 2 extensions + bonus).
- **Weekender Pack ($4.99):** 1,500 Credits.
- **Power User Pack ($9.99):** 3,500 Credits.
- *Logic:* 1 Extension (10 mins) costs **100 Credits**.

### 2. ADD "KARMA POINTS" (Gamification)
I see 'Credits' (Paid), but I am missing the free reward system.
- Please add a secondary currency icon on the Home Screen called **"Karma"** (use a Heart or Star icon).
- **Logic:**
  - If a user completes a 5-minute call without being reported: **+10 Karma**.
  - If a user Pays to Extend: **+50 Karma**.
- Show a simple "Karma Level" on the profile (e.g., "Level 1 Listener").

### 3. UI UPGRADE: "THE BLIND DECK"
On the "Daily Cards" screen (Image 7), the list view looks too much like a contact list.
- Please change this to a **2-Column Grid View**.
- Instead of text ("Anonymous Match #1"), show **Card Backs** (Rectangles with a gradient/pattern).
- **Animation:** When I tap a card, it should "flip" or pulse before showing "Connecting...". This creates the "Mystery Box" excitement.

### 4. THE "TIME BANK" DISPLAY
Our USP is that if a call drops, users get a refund. They need to see this to trust us.
- In the **Credits Store** (Image 6), add a small visual section at the top called **"Time Bank"**.
- Text: *"Priority Tokens: 0"*.
- Subtext: *"If a paid call drops, your refund appears here."*

### 5. HOME SCREEN COUNTER
On the Home Screen (Image 3), I need to see how many free matches I have left immediately.
- Add a small counter badge near the "Daily Deck" section: **"Matches Left: 10/10"**.
- If it hits 0/10, the "Daily Deck" greys out and prompts the "Refill ($0.99)" modal.

Please implement these changes to finalize the MVP.
