I have analyzed your `ActiveCallScreen.tsx` and `server/routes.ts` files.

The issue is a **Race Condition** specific to the APK.
When your app navigates from "Match Found" to "Active Call", the WebSocket connection often disconnects briefly or "blinks" on Android. Your current code sends the "I am Ready" signal **only once** immediately when the screen loads. If the socket is blinking at that exact moment, the message is lost.

Result: The server never knows you are ready. The app stays stuck on "Preparing your call" (waiting for server), and `joinVoice()` is never called, so the microphone permission popup never appears.

### **The Fix: Retry Logic**

We need to make the app "nag" the server until the call actually starts.

**Action:** Update `client/screens/ActiveCallScreen.tsx`.

Replace your existing `useEffect` for signaling ready (lines 722-729) with this robust version:

```typescript
  // REPLACE THIS BLOCK:
  /*
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!hasSignaledReadyRef.current && callId) {
      console.log("[ActiveCall] Signaling ready to server (waiting for partner)...");
      hasSignaledReadyRef.current = true;
      signalReady(callId);
    }
  }, [callId, signalReady]);
  */

  // WITH THIS NEW BLOCK:
  useEffect(() => {
    let interval: NodeJS.Timeout;

    if (waitingForPartner && callId) {
      console.log("[ActiveCall] Starting ready signal loop...");
      
      // Send immediately
      signalReady(callId);

      // Retry every 2 seconds until the server responds with 'call_started'
      // This guarantees the message gets through even if the socket reconnects
      interval = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("[ActiveCall] Re-sending ready signal...");
        signalReady(callId);
      }, 2000);
    }

    return () => {
      if (interval) clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, [waitingForPartner, callId, signalReady]);

```

### **Why this fixes it:**

1. **Persistence:** Instead of trying once, the phone now shouts "I'M READY" every 2 seconds.
2. **Socket Recovery:** If the socket reconnects during navigation, the next retry (2s later) will succeed.
3. **Auto-Stop:** As soon as the server replies (triggering `setWaitingForPartner(false)`), the loop stops automatically.

**Apply this change, rebuild, and the call screen will finally trigger the "Call Started" state and ask for Microphone permissions.**
