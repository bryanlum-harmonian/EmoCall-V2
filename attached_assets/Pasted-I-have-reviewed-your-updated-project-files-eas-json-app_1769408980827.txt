I have reviewed your updated project files (eas.json, app.json, and client/App.tsx).

Great news: You have successfully applied the 3 most critical fixes.

✅ No Port 5000: Your eas.json now correctly points to https://emocall.harmonian.online.

✅ Timeout Guard: Your App.tsx now uses Promise.race, so the app will force open after 3 seconds even if fonts fail.

✅ Native Font Config: You added the expo-font plugin to app.json.

However, I spot one path error that might cause the build to fail or the fonts to be ignored.

The Issue: File Path Mismatch in app.json
Where your files are: Your font files seem to be located in client/assets/fonts/ (based on your App.tsx and file structure).

Where app.json is looking: Your configuration tells Expo to look in ./assets/fonts/ (the root assets folder, not the client folder).

If your folder structure is:

Plaintext
/ (Root)
  ├── app.json
  ├── client/
      ├── App.tsx
      └── assets/
          └── fonts/
              └── Nunito-Bold.ttf
Then your app.json will fail to find the fonts because it is looking in Root/assets/fonts instead of Root/client/assets/fonts.

The Fix
You have two options. Option A is safer for your current setup.

Option A: Update app.json paths
Change the paths in app.json to include the client/ folder.

JSON
// In app.json
"plugins": [
  [
    "expo-font",
    {
      "fonts": [
        "./client/assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf",
        "./client/assets/fonts/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf",
        "./client/assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf"
      ]
    }
  ],
  // ...
]
Option B: Move the files
Move the fonts folder from client/assets/ to a new assets/ folder in the main root directory. If you do this, you must also update the require() paths in your App.tsx to ../../assets/fonts/.... (This is messier, so stick to Option A).

Final Check Before You Build
Once you fix that path in app.json:

Commit the change:

Bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix font paths in app.json"
git push
Run the Build:

Bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
You are very close to a working APK!
